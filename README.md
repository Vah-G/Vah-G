## About me
I am studying cybersecurity and using GitHub to collect and organize
the practical things I work on while learning.
Most of my focus right now is on understanding how security works at a basic level,
especially in networking and web connections.

## What I'm learning
- Network fundamentals and access control (ACL)
- How HTTPS, SSL and TLS work in practice
- Basic Linux usage
- First steps in log analysis

## Projects
- **HTTPS Certificate Checker**  
  This project was made to better understand HTTPS connections and
  how SSL/TLS certificates are used. It checks basic certificate
  parameters and helps see common configuration issues.

- **Network Security Labs**  
  A set of small networking labs related to access control and basic
  security concepts. I add new labs as I continue learning.

## Goals
- Build a strong base in cybersecurity fundamentals
- Get more practical experience, not only theoretical knowledge
- Explore different areas of information security before choosing a specialization
